# Stock-Screener
Quantitative stock screener inspired by 'Magic Formula Investing' by Joel Greenblatt

This project is a stock screener developed in Python. It takes data webscraped from Marketwatch.com to perform quantitative analysis on various stocks. In order to determine the performance of my algorithim, I have taken the top 20% of stock picks and invested them equally in a simulated stock market game. I have also taken the bottom 20% of stocks and have done the same thing. Test stocks were determined by using Simple Random Sampling on stocks posted in various industries on CNNMoney.com


My algorithim determines the rating of a stock by analyzing EBIT, ROIC, Price to Sales Ratio, Price to Book Ratio, and Market Cap. The fundamental goal of this project was to use stock data to find undervalued stocks from well-performing companies. The portfolio will be rebalanced and add/remove stocks as they fall in/out of the 20% every month.

This ReadMe will contain weekly updates of how well each portfolio performs in comparison to the Vanguard Total Index Fund below.
