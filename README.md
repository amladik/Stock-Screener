# Stock-Screener
Quantitative stock screener inspired by 'Magic Formula Investing' by Joel Greenblatt

This project is a stock screener developed in Python. It takes data webscraped from Marketwatch.com to perform quantitative analysis on various stocks. In order to determine the performance of my algorithim, I have taken the top 20% of stock picks and invested them equally in a simulated stock market game. Test stocks were determined by using Simple Random Sampling on stocks posted in various industries on CNNMoney.com
